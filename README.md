## TRUE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR - TRNG

A Pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) helps you efficiently generate random numbers, but in a lot of applications true random numbers are required. 
In this program, we test a few features that use true random numbers (HotBits, RANDOM.org and Java's Secure Random package), comparing it to Pseudorandom generators.
